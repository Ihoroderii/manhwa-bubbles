- ✅ Automation started automatically on push
- ✅ Your package is being tested on multiple Python versions
- ✅ Build artifacts will be generated

## Current Workflow Status

**Build and Test #1**: Running for commit 819c845
- Testing on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Running your test suite (`test_library.py`)
- Running demo script (`examples/demo.py`)
- Building the package

## Next Steps

### 1. Monitor Your Build
Visit: https://github.com/Ihoroderii/manhwa-bubbles/actions

You should see:
- 🟡 Yellow dot = Running
- ✅ Green checkmark = Success
- ❌ Red X = Failed (if any issues)

### 2. Once Build Completes Successfully
You can create your first automated release:

```bash
# Update version to 1.0.1
# Edit setup.py: change version="1.0.0" to version="1.0.1"
# Edit manhwa_bubbles/__init__.py: change __version__ = "1.0.0" to __version__ = "1.0.1"

git add setup.py manhwa_bubbles/__init__.py
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.1"
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

This will trigger:
- Automatic release creation
- Package building
- Publishing to GitHub releases

### 3. Check Build Artifacts
After the build completes, you'll find package files in the Actions artifacts section.
